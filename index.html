                The simulation starts with a given pool of infected people, which fall
                sick for a given amount of days and have a given chance of dying during
                their sickness, with a mortality that depends on their age
                (see above). A sick person will infect a given number of other people
                while sick, the total number of infections over the
                course of the sickness is given as the infection rate
                (you can tune this parameter). Only healthy people can be infected,
                i.e. once someone is cured we assume that person cannot be infected again.
                Also, we assume that the infection rate is based on the number of interactions
                with other people from the population, hence when the number of healthy
                vs. cured and infected people decreases in a given age cohort, the chance of
                infecting someone from that cohort also decreases.
                <br /><br />
                We use the age distribution of the German population to evaluate
                the effect of the infection on different age cohorts.
                By varying the infection rate you can get a feeling for how
                different rates affect the number of deceased people, the 
                speed of the spreading of the infection and the maximum number
                of infected people.

                    This is not a realistic simulation, it only provides a
                    (hopefully) intuitive way
                    to visualize the relationship between infection rate and the
                    spreading of the infection through the population.
