            <p class="lead box">
                Hi! This is a simple, cohort-based epidemic simulation. It starts
                with a small pool of around 175 infected people, which fall
                sick for 14 days and have a given chance of dying during
                their sickness, with a mortality that depends on their age
                (see below). A sick person will infect a given number of people
                while sick, where the total number of infected people over the
                entire course of the sickness equals the infection rate (given below).
                We use the age distribution of the German population to evaluate
                the effect of the infection on different age cohorts.
                By varying the infection rate you can get a feeling for how
                different rates affect the number of deceased people, the 
                speed of the spreading of the infection and the maximum number
                of infected people.
                <br />

                <span class="warning">
                    This is not a realistic simulation , it only provides a
                    (hopefully) intuitive way
                    to visualize the relationship between infection rate and the
                    spreading of the infection through the population.
